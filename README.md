It was my college project did on 2016,
 Input design is the process of converting the user-oriented input to a computer based format. The design is a part of overall system design that needs careful attention. Input design involves the selection of the best strategy for getting data into the computer system at the right time and as accurately as possible. This is because the most difficult aspect of input design in accuracy. The use of well-defined documents can encourage users to record data accurately without omission.
The collection of input data is considered to be the most expensive part of the system design. Since the inputs have to be planned in such a way so as to get the relevant information, extreme care is taken to obtain the pertinent information. If the data going into the system is incorrect then the processing and outputs will magnify these errors. The goal of designing input data entry is, make it easy, logical and free from errors as possible. Input errors can be greatly reduced when inputting directly by using appropriate forms for data capture and well-designed computer screen layout.
The following are the objectives of input design:
⦁	To produce a cost effective method of input.
⦁	To make the input forms understandable to the end users.
⦁	To ensure the validation of data inputs.
The nature of input data is determined partially during logical system design. However, the nature of inputs on the system is also determined. Efforts has been made to ensure that input data remains accurate from the stage at which it is recorded and documented to the stage at which it is accepted by the computer. Validation procedures are also present to detect errors in data input, which is beyond control procedures. Validation procedures are designed to check each record, data item or field against certain criteria.
Pi Media Center and Casting System provides application interfaces for accepting inputs for navigating media center from client using arrows, Controlling the video playerback (play, pause, stop, rewind, forward, etc.…)

4.2 OUTPUT DESIGN
 The output design phase of the system design is concerned with the conveyance of information to the end users in a user friendly manner. The output design should be efficient and intelligible, so that the systems relationship with the end user is improved and thereby enhancing the process of decision making. Output design involves specifying how production of on-screen reports and paper-based reports will occur. Output may occur to database or file for storing information entered or also for use by other systems. 
Design Outputs must contain and/or make reference to "acceptance criteria". Think of acceptance criteria as a tolerance of sorts. In order to adequately evaluate Design Outputs, Design Verification is necessary. And this evaluation is comparing Design Outputs against Design Inputs.
The output design is an ongoing activity almost from the beginning of the project, and follows the principles of form design. Efficient and well-defined output design improves the relation of the system and the user, thus facilitating decision making. The primary considerations in the design of the output are the requirement of the information and the objectives of the end users.
The system output may be of any of the following
⦁	A webpage.
⦁	A document.
⦁	An Email
Pi Media Center and Casting Device has one and only output device i.e. Media Center TV Screen. The media center give response to user request by playing video or streaming videos.

4.4 HIERARCHICAL CHART  
A Hierarchical Chart (SC) in software engineering and organizational theory, is a chart which shows the breakdown of a system to its lowest manageable levels. They are used in structured programming to arrange program modules into a tree. Each module is represented by a box, which contains the module's name. The tree structure visualizes the relationships between modules.
A Hierarchical chart is a diagram that shows all the functions involved in your system in a hierarchical manner like in an organizational chart. Unlike the process model or the data flow diagram, it does not show the organizational units involved in the functions, the data stores or the data flows. It just specifies the Parental Function (the function at the very top) and the sub or child functions underneath it. Each child function can also be broken down into further sub functions.
A Hierarchical diagram is an overall approach to identifying the components of the system at different level of abstraction and detail. Usually it is developed using a top-down approach, moving from the highest conceptual level down to the greatest acceptable levels of granularity; hence presents a parent-child relationship among different levels of modules, with the top level being the parent and the bottom level being the child.
Having a structure consisting of multiple levels. A hierarchical business structure would mean that the chain of command looks like a pyramid, with a large base of workers, who are directly supervised by the smaller level above them, who are in turn supervised by the level above them, continuing on to the top ranking officer such as the company President or CEO. Alternatively, anything which can be broken down into a series of levels which range from broad to specific can be considered hierarchical.
Goals
⦁	Simplify the development of a system.
⦁	Allow for reuse of certain components.
⦁	Identify the importance of certain components.
